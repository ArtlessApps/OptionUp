      "explanation_wrong": "Unknown timing = buy more time. 30-60 days works if you think move is 'within 2 months.' But 'boom over next year' suggests longer (90-180 days or LEAPS). Give yourself cushion - better to overpay for time than run out of time."

      "explanation_wrong": "When learning, you WILL be wrong about timing. 60-90 day options give you room for error. Weeklies expire too fast (you're still figuring it out). LEAPS cost too much for experiments. Start with monthlies, graduate to weeklies once you have edge."

      "explanation_wrong": "Math is brutal here: 4 days left, theta -$75/day = you'll bleed $300 by Friday. Stock needs to move $300 just to break even on time decay PLUS the move you need for profit. Probability is against you. Professional traders cut weekly losers fast."
