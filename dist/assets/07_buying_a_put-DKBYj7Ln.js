Buy puts when: 1) BEARISH (think stock drops), 2) HEDGING (own stock, want protection), or 3) VOLATILITY (expecting big move down). Puts are insurance OR speculation on declines.",explanation_wrong:"Remember: PUTS profit when stock goes DOWN. Buy puts when you're bearish (think price drops), or as insurance if you own the stock. Think: recession fears, earnings miss, sector rotation OUT of your stock."},{screen_type:"scenario",question:"You own 100 shares of NVDA at $500. You're worried about a tech selloff. Best protective strategy?",options:["Buy a $550 put (above your cost)","Buy a $480 put (slightly below your cost)","Buy a $400 put (far below your cost)","Don't use options - just hope"],correct:1,xp_reward:15,explanation_correct:"Smart hedging! The $480 put costs moderate premium and protects most of your value. If NVDA crashes to $300, you can still sell at $480. You risk $20/share ($2k) but protect against unlimited downside. Insurance that makes sense.",explanation_wrong:"Hedging 101: Choose a strike close to your cost basis. $550 = too expensive (above stock price). $400 = too cheap but you'd lose $100/share before protection kicks in. $480 = sweet spot for affordable protection."},{screen_type:"scenario",question:"Market sentiment is terrible.

This is a SPECULATIVE put (not protective). You're betting on a market drop. Buy puts on SPY, QQQ, or weak stocks. If market crashes 10%, your puts could return 200-500%. This is how traders profit from fear.",explanation_wrong:"If you don't own the stock, buying puts is SPECULATION (not hedging). You're betting on price drops.
