That's a 200% return while the stock moved 20%!",explanation_wrong:"Let's calculate: Stock at $300, your strike is $270 = $30/share of value. That's $3,000 per contract.

A call's P/L line goes up infinitely because stocks can theoretically go to infinity. A put's line would go down (profit as stock drops) but STOPS at $0 since stocks can't go negative.
