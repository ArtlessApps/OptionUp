They pass on 95% of opportunities and only trade when everything aligns. This lesson covers the 8 situations where you should NEVER trade, no matter how tempting it looks.",visual:"checklist_red_x.png",highlight_words:["pass on 95%","NEVER trade","no matter how tempting"]},{screen_type:"scenario",headline:"Red Flag #1: Low volume/open interest",question:"You find a perfect setup on a small-cap stock. But the options only have 50 open interest and bid-ask spread is $2 wide. What should you do?",options:["Pass - illiquid options are non-negotiable","Trade it anyway - the setup is perfect","Use limit orders to get filled","Only trade half position"],correct:0,xp_reward:10,explanation_correct:"Correct! Wide spreads = lose 10-20% immediately. Can't exit when you need to. Get filled at terrible prices. Never trade options with <1,000 open interest or <500 daily volume. Liquidity is NON-NEGOTIABLE.",explanation_wrong:"It doesn't matter how good the setup is if you can't get in or out at fair prices. Wide bid-ask spreads eat your profits before you even start. Always require minimum liquidity standards."},{screen_type:"scenario",headline:"Red Flag #2: Buying straddles when IV is already high",question:"TSLA earnings tomorrow. IV is 120%. You think 'big move coming!' and consider buying a straddle. Should you?",options:["No - IV crush will destroy you after earnings","Yes - big moves mean profits","Buy it but exit before earnings","Buy extra contracts to compensate"],correct:0,xp_reward:10,explanation_correct:"Smart! You're buying at PEAK IV. IV crush will destroy you after earnings. You need 20%+ move just to breakeven. The move is already priced in. When IV rank is >70% before catalyst, DON'T buy straddles - consider selling premium instead.",explanation_wrong:"When everyone expects volatility, it's priced into premiums. You're buying expensive lottery tickets at the worst time. After the event, IV collapses and wipes out value even if stock moves."},{screen_type:"scenario",headline:"Red Flag #3: Revenge trading",question:"You lost $2,000 on a bad trade this morning. You immediately look for another trade to recover the loss. What should you do?",options:["Take 24-hour break minimum - never trade to 'get even'","Double position size to make it back faster","Trade immediately before you lose confidence","Switch to opposite strategy"],correct:0,xp_reward:10,explanation_correct:"Exactly! Emotional decision-making leads to bigger losses. After a losing trade, take a 24-hour break minimum. The market doesn't care what you lost. Never trade to 'get even.' This is the #1 account killer.",explanation_wrong:"Revenge trading is driven by emotion, not logic. It leads to bigger position sizing, ignoring your rules, and usually results in bigger losses. Losses are part of trading - accept them and move on."},{screen_type:"scenario",headline:"Red Flag #4: FOMO trades",question:"NVDA is up 30% this month. Twitter is full of gains posts. You feel like you're missing out and want to buy calls near the top. Should you?",options:["No - if you feel FOMO, it's probably too late","Yes - momentum continues","Buy puts instead","Buy small position to test"],correct:0,xp_reward:10,explanation_correct:"Correct! You're late - the best move already happened. Buying at euphoria = bad prices. No thesis, just emotion. Usually marks the top. The best trades feel uncomfortable, not exciting. FOMO trades are how retail loses to professionals.",explanation_wrong:"FOMO means you're chasing, not leading. When everyone is talking about gains, you're likely buying at the peak from professionals who are selling. Wait for the next opportunity with a clear thesis."},{screen_type:"key_terms",headline:"Four more deadly mistakes",cards:[{term:"Trading near expiration (<7 days)",definition:"Gamma risk, all-or-nothing, stressful",example:"Rule: Close spreads at 21 days, never buy <14 days"},{term:"Oversized positions",definition:"One trade can wreck your account",example:"Rule: Never risk >5% of account on single trade"},{term:"Trading during low volume hours",definition:"Spreads widen, bad fills, whipsaw",example:"Rule: Only trade 9:45am-3:30pm ET"},{term:"Trading without a plan",definition:"Don't know when to exit",example:"Rule: Define exit BEFORE entering"}]},{screen_type:"summary_cards",headline:"The NOT-to-do list",cards:[{front:"Illiquid options",back:"Open interest <1,000 | Volume <500 | Bid-ask spread >5% → PASS"},{front:"High IV before events",back:"IV >70% percentile + catalyst tomorrow → Don't buy premium, consider selling"},{front:"Emotional trading",back:"After a loss → 24hr break | Feel FOMO → probably too late | Revenge mindset → disaster"},{front:"Execution mistakes",back:"Near expiration → Close early | No exit plan → Don't enter | Oversized → Reduce position"},{front:"The golden rule",back:"When in doubt, DON'T TRADE.
