Earnings = immediate price move. You want the SHORTEST expiration to capture that move at lowest cost. This Friday captures the post-earnings pop. Longer expirations waste money on time you don't need.",explanation_wrong:"Earnings create immediate volatility. You need short-dated options (this Friday) because: 1) They're cheaper, 2) You'll know by Friday if you're right, 3) No point paying for extra time if the move happens Thursday.
